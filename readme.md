# RESTfull API in golang using mongodb atlas API

Any help or comment is well accepted

Thanks

Took many stuff from [Nick Jackson's videos](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/building-microservices-youtube) and the [The Polyglot Developer](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2019/02/developing-restful-api-golang-mongodb-nosql-database/)

I have added a Dockerfile and compose file to dockerize the app. Next steps are monitor the app with [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), maybe following [Gabriel Tanner's blog](https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/collecting-prometheus-metrics-in-golang)


## Grafana
